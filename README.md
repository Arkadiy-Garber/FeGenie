Nearly all forms of life are depended on iron for bascila cellualr maintenance and growth. Microorganisms are often tasked with survival and growth in environments where iron is scantily available. To overcome this challenge, a variety of mechanisms have evolved to allow organisms to compete for whatever small concentration of iron is available to them. These mechanisms have been widely studied over the past several decades.
